## TODOs

1.  Update font to RSU, RSU Text and KeepCalm, and update style according to JWCx CI

2.  The user might re-enter the registration subdomain directly. Re-auth, then check if the user had already chosen their major, and redirect from / if user is already logged in.

3.  Check if user is authenticated in steppers and verify, then redirect out if they haven't authenticated yet. (Optimistic UI)

4.  Fix Back Button Bugs on Safari

Nice to have: Resume to previously completed steps

Won't Fix: Set Design Uploader to Full Height with Fixed Width (Not Possible because it is a dropzone, not a normal `<img />` tag)
