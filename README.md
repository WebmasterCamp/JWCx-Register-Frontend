## TODOs

1.  Update font to RSU, RSU Text and KeepCalm, and update style according to JWCx CI

2.  The user might re-enter the registration subdomain directly. Re-auth, then check if the user had already chosen their major, and redirect from / if user is already logged in.

3.  Check if user is authenticated in steppers and verify, then redirect out if they haven't authenticated yet. (Optimistic UI)

Nice to have: Resume to previously completed steps
Consideration: Use React-based DatePicker instead of Native Browser Date Input
