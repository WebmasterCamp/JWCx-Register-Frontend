## TODOs

1.  Add more Form Types: Dropdown Select for Religion, Grade and Shirt Size, and DatePicker for Birthdate.

2.  Update font to RSU, RSU Text and KeepCalm, and update style according to JWCx CI

3.  The user might re-enter the registration subdomain directly. Re-auth, then check if the user had already chosen their major, and redirect from / if user is already logged in.

4.  Check if user is authenticated in steppers and verify, then redirect out if they haven't authenticated yet. (Optimistic UI)

Nice to have: Resume to previously completed steps
